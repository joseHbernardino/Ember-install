4. **Website Configuration**
   - In the "Website" section, click on the root path displayed `/www/wwwroot/{DOMAIN}`
     - Delete all files within this folder. (Some files might not delete in bulk, so delete them one by one if necessary)
   - Upload the Web folder downloaded from the Ember site.
   - Configure the `config.php` file.
